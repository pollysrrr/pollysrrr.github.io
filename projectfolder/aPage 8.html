    The monk says: 
    when you choose one power you will get a consequence. 
    But, if you do not choose a power you will walk out powerless and naked. 
    You must choose a power, either flight or invisibility. 
    If you must choose flight, every time you fly a random person will drop dead. 
    You wouldn't know if that person was someone's sister or mother or father. 

    Now, if you must choose invisibility, everytime you are invisible your family member will get sick. 
    You wouldn't know if it was just a cold or cancer. 

    The choice is yours, Your choices have repercussions. 
    Choose well my child. 
    and go forth and walk.
